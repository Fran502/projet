WP Twitter Feeds - A simple widget which lets you add your latest tweets in just a few clicks on your website.

== Description ==

An easy Twitter feeds widget that provides facility to display twitter tweets on your website using the latest Twitter 1.1 API. A simple widget which lets you add your latest tweets in widget areas. Get started in just a few clicks and use the provided Widget to easily display your Tweets on your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to create a Twitter Application =

1. Visit the Twitter Developers Site: The first thing you need to do is head on down to dev.twitter.com. In order to create an account, all you need to do is click on Sign In link at the top right.

2. Sign in with your Twitter Account: Next, sign in with the Twitter account you want to associate with your app. You do have a Twitter account don't you?!

3. Go to My Applications: Once you're logged in, click on the downward arrow to the right of your Twitter image and select "My Applications". This is where all your registered Twitter apps will appear.

4. Create a New Application: If you are new to the Developers site you won't see any applications registered. Either way, it's time to create our first application. To do this, click on the big "Create a new application" button.

5. Fill in your Application Details: It's been easy so far, but this screen often makes people confused. Don't worry, it's a lot easier than you think. First of all you need to give your app a unique name (one that no one else has used for their Twitter app). Since we're going to create an app for personal use and not for other people who can register and use, so just put your domain name in or perhaps even your name. You don't have to worry much about the descriptions you can change this later. I have put "a set of Twitter tools for personal use". Put your website in the website fieldâ€“ don't worry that it isn't (as Twitter ask) your application's publicly accessible home page. However, this website will be where your app is hosted.For now ignore the Callback URL field. If you are allowing users to log into your app to authenticate themselves, you'd enter the URL where they would be returned after they've given permission to Twitter to use your app. Once you've done this, make sure you've read the "Developer Rules Of The Road" blurb, check the "Yes, I agree" box, fill in the CAPTCHA (don't you just love them) and click the "create your Twitter Application" button. Hurrah!

6. Create Your Access Token.

7. Make a note of your OAuth Settings.
